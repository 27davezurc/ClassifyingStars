# ClassifyingStars
Built a random forest model in R with 88% accuracy using a 60/40 train/test split to classify stars as giants or dwarfs given their visual apparent magnitude, distance between the star and Earth, B-V color index, and absolute magnitude.
Added the csv file of the data set, added the R source code for the random forest model built, and included the report/documentation of my process and findings.
